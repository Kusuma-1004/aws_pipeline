A Simple Jenkins CI/CD pipeline hosted on EC2 Instance
# Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline with Python and Docker

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins to automate the build and deployment of a Python Flask application containerized with Docker. The Jenkins server is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance, and the pipeline pulls source code from GitHub, builds a Docker image, and runs the container.
